"2023-04-04","On April 4, 2023, a correction was made to new NAICS 2022 series at the 3 and 4 digit levels for earnings.  The data was to be published with decimal places and not in whole numbers."



Footnotes:
1,"The quality indicators take into account various factors that affect the quality of the data, notably the CV, the non-response errors and the imputation errors. Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D - Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish or sample size is too small to produce reliable estimates."
2,"Some series exhibit no clear seasonal pattern. In such cases the data are not adjusted."
3,"The introduction of administrative data in 2001 and the associated change in methodology resulted in level shifts for some series. This affects the comparability of pre- and post-2001 estimates."
4,"Estimates for the latest reference month are preliminary."
5,"Earnings data are based on gross payroll before source deductions."
6,"Industry estimates in this table are based on the 2022 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Version 1.0."
